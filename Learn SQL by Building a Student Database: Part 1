Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 1
SQL as we know it is the language for communicating with a relational database.
In this 140-lesson course, I created a Bash script that uses SQL to enter information about computer science students into PostgreSQL.

Opened new terminal echo hello SQL
Started 2 .csv files (titles & values)
Added info into Postgresql DB (view by using \l)
Created new DB named students CREATE DATABASE students;
Connected new DB (used \c students)
4 tables created:
Created students table CREATE TABLE students();
Created majors table CREATE TABLE majors();
Created courses table CREATE TABLE courses();
Created majors & courses- junction table CREATE TABLE majors_courses(); 
Checked all 4 tables to ensure there (view by using \d)
Now, onto to the columns
The students.csv file has 4 fields
Made a column for each as an ID column
Added column to students table named student_id
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;
First column in students.csv is first_name
Added column ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
Second column is last_name
Added column ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
